# Internal Sample Log

An Excel-based compliance automation tool designed to help cannabis licensees
track internal product samples and enforce Michigan regulatory limits
over a rolling 30-day period.

The system reduces manual METRC adjustments by generating structured CSV uploads
and flagging compliance risks before violations occur.

product samples. Tracking rolling 30-day totals across employees, product types,
and THC thresholds is error-prone when done manually.
